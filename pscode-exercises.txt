// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 numbers together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if (num % 2) ==0;
	print("{0} is Even".format(num))
else:
	print({0} is Odd".format(num))

ask for a number
if number/2 gives remainder of 0 its even,
if remainder is 1 its odd.
print even or odd.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

num_list = [num1, num2, num3, num4, num5]
avg = sum(num_list)/len(num_list)
print("Average of list: ", round(avg,2));
print("min=",min(1));
print("max=",max(1));


read 5 numbers.
sum of all numbers in list % number of elements in list.
print min.
print max. 

num_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
Average of list: 3
min = 1
max = 5
